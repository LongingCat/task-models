Tools to manipulate and use task models for human robot collaboration.

If you are using this software and or one of its components, we warmly recommend you to cite the following paper:

    [Roncone2017] Roncone Alessandro, Mangin Olivier, Scassellati Brian **Transparent Role Assignment and Task Allocation in Human Robot Collaboration** *IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2017)*, Singapore. `[PDF] <http://alecive.github.io/papers/[Roncone%20et%20al.%202017]%20Transparent%20Role%20Assignment%20and%20Task%20Allocation%20in%20Human%20Robot%20Collaboration.pdf>`_ `[BIB] <http://alecive.github.io/papers/[Roncone%20et%20al.%202017]%20Transparent%20Role%20Assignment%20and%20Task%20Allocation%20in%20Human%20Robot%20Collaboration.bib>`_

Prerequisites
-------------

This package requires a binary from Anthony Cassandra's POMDP solver. Please visit `pomdp.org <http://www.pomdp.org/>`_ for any matter related to the POMDP solver. In order to be using the *simplex* finite grid method, a fork of the version from `cmansley <https://github.com/cmansley/pomdp-solve>`_ needs to be installed that contains a fix to the original code. You can get the fork `here <https://github.com/scazlab/pomdp-solve>`.

Here are some instructions on how to compile and install the solver properly (assuming that :code:`~/src` is the directory in which you usually place your code)::

   cd ~/src
   git clone https://github.com/scazlab/pomdp-solve
   cd pomdp-solve
   mkdir build
   cd build/
   ../configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
   make
   make install


Now you should have :code:`pomdp-solve` installed in your local path, and it should be available for the python package to be used.

ICRA 2017
---------

To generate the policy from the experiment in [Roncone2017], please use the script :code:`samples/icra_scenario2pomdp.py`. The script will generate the corresponding POMDP model, solve it with Anthony Cassandra's POMDP solver, and store the corresponding policy under :code:`visualization/policy/json/icra.json`. To run the full experiment on the baxter robot, please refer to `github.com/ScazLab/baxter_collaboration <https://github.com/ScazLab/baxter_collaboration>`_.
